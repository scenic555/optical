Description: An R package for optimal item calibaration in computerized achievement tests.
 With this `optical` package, a set of items that require calibration can be
 optimally allocated to a group of examinees. The optimization process
 utilizes the restricted optimal design method, which has been described
 in detail by Ul Hassan and Miller in their works published in
 [**2019**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11336-019-09673-6)
 and [**2021**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2021.107177). To use the
 method, preliminary item characteristics must be provided as input.
 These characteristics can either be expert guesses or based on previous
 calibration with a small number of examinees. The item characteristics
 should be described in the form of parameters for an Item Response
 Theory (IRT) model. These models can include the Rasch model, the
 2-parameter logistic model, the 3-parameter logistic model, or a mixture
 of these models. The output consists of a set of rules for each item
 that determine which examinees should be assigned to each item. The
 efficiency or gain achieved through the optimal design is quantified by
 comparing it to a random allocation. This comparison allows for an
 assessment of how much improvement or advantage is gained by using the
 optimal design approach. This work was supported by the Swedish Research Council
 (Vetenskapsrådet) Grant 2019-02706.
