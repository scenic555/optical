# Changes in optical 1.8

* The `optical` function can handle the calibration of a substantial number of   items (100-200) by grouping them into blocks of 3-5 items each.

* The `efficiency` function can now provide the efficiency of the optimal        design compared to a random design for each block.

* Graphs for the optimal design in each block can now be created using the       `drawdesign` function.

* Convergence plots can be created for each block for monitoring the 
  convergence of optimal item calibration algorithm using the `convergenceplot`   function.

* A new function, `drawdesign_allitems`, has been created to enable users to     display the optimal calibration design for all items in one graph.
